  2.open app.py in gui folder
  3.change the directory in line 15 to the directory of the model on your device
  4.in line 19 change "D:\Machine learning\projects\dog Breed Classification" part to the directory of the folder you added the folders to
      --for example "D:\example\gui\data\Dog_Breed_Identifier_logo-no-bg.ico"
  5.in line 20 do the same as step 4
